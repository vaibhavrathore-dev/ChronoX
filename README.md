# ChronoX
ChronoX is a beginner-level desktop countdown timer built using Python and PyQt5. It includes Start, Pause, Reset, a progress bar, custom alarm sound, and a modern dark UI. This project helped me understand GUI development, event handling, and packaging apps using PyInstaller. More updates coming soon 🚀
